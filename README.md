## File Descriptions

- `src/controllers/index.ts`: This file exports a class `IndexController` which contains methods for handling different routes and interacting with the services.

- `src/models/index.ts`: This file exports Mongoose models for interacting with the database. It defines the schema and methods for each model.

- `src/routes/index.ts`: This file exports a function `setRoutes` which sets up the routes for the application. It uses the `IndexController` to handle the routes.

- `src/services/index.ts`: This file exports classes or functions that encapsulate the business logic of the application. It interacts with the models and performs operations on the data.

- `src/sockets/index.ts`: This file exports functions or classes that handle the WebSocket functionality. It listens for WebSocket connections, sends and receives messages, and performs actions based on the received data.

- `src/app.ts`: This file is the entry point of the application. It creates an instance of the Express app, sets up middleware, connects to the database using Mongoose, and initializes the routes and WebSocket functionality.

- `src/types/index.ts`: This file exports interfaces or types that are used throughout the application. It may include interfaces for request and response objects, data models, or other custom types.

- `tsconfig.json`: This file is the configuration file for TypeScript. It specifies the compiler options and the files to include in the compilation.

- `package.json`: This file is the configuration file for npm. It lists the dependencies and scripts for the project.
